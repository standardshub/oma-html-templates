<section>
<h2>Version 1.0</h2>
<aside class="example">
<p>This section provides a high level, concise and informative description of the <strong>main functionality</strong> supported in the initial enabler or reference release version described in this AD. The description should be brief, target length should be a few paragraphs. When the enabler or reference release is finished, this description should be aligned with the final functionality.</p>
<strong>DELETE THIS COMMENT</strong></aside>

<section>
<h2>Version x.y</h2>
<aside class="example">
<p>This section should be included for each new major or minor version of the RD.</p>
<p>It should provide a high level, concise and informative description of the <strong>new or modified functionality</strong> introduced in this version of the RD, compared to the previous version. The description should be brief, target length should be a few paragraphs. When the release or reference release is finished, this description should be aligned with the final functionality differences.</p>

<h2>Version x.y.z</h2>

<h2>[Release name] release description (Informative)</h2>
<aside class="example">
<p>This clause illustrates what the release is about, describing the release in terms of its functionalities, identifying the actors and their relationships. The inclusion of any pictures to back up text should be kept simple, showing various actors involved. The text shall summarize the functionalities of the release in a generic form which does not constrain terminal or network design. It is intended to allow an understanding of the release without regard to implementation. The description should include functional, charging, administration and configuration, usability, interoperability, privacy aspects as well as interactions with other releases.</p>

<h2>End-to-end Service Description</h2>
<aside class="example">
<p>This section provides indications on what is the business rational for creating such enabler release. The text has to be a high level description of the features and functions provided by the OMA enabler release, including their objectives, when considered as a service (e.g. Mobile Code, Mobile Advertising, Customized Multimedia Ringing, MMS, Mobile Spam Reporting) and/or a building block (e.g. Service User Profile Management , Parlay Service Access, Converged IP Messaging, Device Profile Evolution).</p>
<p>This description should address the end-to-end experience provided by the OMA services (e.g. the end-users prefer to receive advertising contents that are targeted to their interests and needs; they demand that the service provider guarantees that messages are sent by authenticated parties, as they do not want to receive spam). Also, this description should address what are the overall functions of the enabler release to be able to support other enablers (e.g. Service User Profile Management provides one unique central point to access and allow management of user data).</p>
<p>The end-to-end description should address the direct benefits for the end users as well as the indirect benefits for the equipment usage, or network interconnections, or overall operations or content adaptation, to mention just a few.</p>

<h2>Requirements (Normative)</h2>
<aside class="example">
<p>This section should capture the requirements necessary for service releases to support end-to-end interoperability across different devices, networks, service providers and network operators. Linkage of requirements to Use Cases is not mandatory.</p>
<p>In cases where a common or shared requirement document will supply requirements for a section below (e.g. Privacy RD), note it in the appropriate section and reference the requirements to be included. Then, in the table, add any specific requirements not covered by the shared document.</p>
<p>Each requirement listed in the tables below includes an indication of release. The value for the release should identify the release in which the requirement desired, expected, or is fulfilled. In early phases of RD development preceding the RD Review, this field should provide guidance on preferences. Before commencing the Consistency Review, the fields should be updated, if needed, to reflect the actual requirement coverage fulfilled by the release.</p>
<p>Within the requirement description column in the tables of the following sections, &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; might be optionally included. These notes will be considered informative material. Notes are intended to be used to include any kind of information that could help to clarify the corresponding requirement (meaning, applicability, implications, etc).</p>
<p>In order to improve further development it is recommended that the reason for classifying a requirement as "SHOULD" or &ldquo;MAY&rdquo;(instead of "SHALL") shall be given as an "Informational Note" for each such requirement. See the following example:</p>

<h2>High-Level Functional Requirements</h2>
<aside class="example">
<p>This clause identifies the high level functional requirements for this release. These requirements will be used to describe and derive the functions and interfaces that the release will support, and which defines its core purpose. When writing requirements, care should be taken to recognise the difference between the release specifying a mechanism to perform a function versus its required usage in any given deployment. Requirements shall be presented at a high level, and not assume or imply the technology or implementation of the requirements. Whenever a requirement is directly attributable to a particular actor, it is recommended to mention it.</p>
<p>Examples of such requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The XYZ release SHOULD support content delivery estimation time before and /or during service execution.</li>
<li>The XYZ release MUST be capable of supporting the Service Provider to log information about invocations of this release</li>
<li>XYZ release MUST allow the end user to terminate a session</li>
<li>The XYZ release MUST allow actor X to perform function Y</li>
</ul>
<p>If possible, requirements should be listed in a logical sequence that intuitively captures the behaviour of the release (or feature of the release). In order to get a good readability and quality of RDs, some additional Sections (&ldquo;Heading 2&rdquo;) and Subsections should be identified, that group together requirements related to a specific functionality, avoiding having the most of the requirements as High-Level Functional requirements.</p>

<h2>Use Cases (Informative)</h2>
<aside class="example">
<p>This clause provides high-level use cases focused on the users and deployment scenarios point of view, targeting release&rsquo;s requirements. Use cases are additional to the main text in the RD and facilitate clarification of the requirements: actually, a use case has to be considered needed (and then added to the RD) when it helps the understanding of a set of requirements. For this reason, it is recommended that the total number of use cases be minimised. Pre conditions and Actors involved MAY be described at the beginning of each use case if this is found to be useful.</p>
